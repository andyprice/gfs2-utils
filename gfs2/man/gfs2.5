.SH SYNOPSIS
Overview of the GFS2 filesystem

.SH DESCRIPTION

GFS2 is a clustered filesystem, designed for sharing data between 
multiple nodes
connected to a common shared storage device. It can also be used as a
local filesystem on a single node, however since the design is aimed
at clusters, that will usually result in lower performance than using
a filesystem designed specifically for single node use.

GFS2 is a journaling filesystem and one journal is required for each node
that will mount the filesystem. The one exception to that is spectator
mounts which are equivalent to mounting a read-only block device and as
such can neither recover a journal or write to the filesystem, so do not
require a journal assigned to them.

The GFS2 documentation has been split into a number of sections:

\fBmkfs.gfs2\fP(8) Create a GFS2 filesystem
.br
\fBfsck.gfs2\fP(8) The GFS2 filesystem checker
.br
\fBgfs2_grow\fP(8) Growing a GFS2 filesystem
.br
\fBgfs2_jadd\fP(8) Adding a journal to a GFS2 filesystem
.br
\fBtunegfs2\fP(8) Tool to manipulate GFS2 superblocks
.br
\fBgfs2_edit\fP(8) A GFS2 debug tool (use with caution)

.SH MOUNT OPTIONS

.TP
\fBlockproto=\fP\fILockProtoName\fR
This specifies which inter-node lock protocol is used by the GFS2 filesystem
for this mount, overriding the default lock protocol name stored in the
filesystem's on-disk superblock.

The \fILockProtoName\fR must be one of the supported locking protocols,
currently these are \fIlock_nolock\fR and \fIlock_dlm\fR.

The default lock protocol name is written to disk initially when creating the
filesystem with \fBmkfs.gfs2\fP(8), -p option.  It can be changed on-disk by
using the \fBtunegfs2\fP(8) command.

The \fBlockproto\fP mount option should be used only under special
circumstances in which you want to temporarily use a different lock protocol
without changing the on-disk default. Using the incorrect lock protocol
on a cluster filesystem mounted from more than one node will almost
certainly result in filesystem corruption.
.TP
\fBlocktable=\fP\fILockTableName\fR
This specifies the identity of the cluster and of the filesystem for this
mount, overriding the default cluster/filesystem identify stored in the
filesystem's on-disk superblock.  The cluster/filesystem name is recognized
globally throughout the cluster, and establishes a unique namespace for
the inter-node locking system, enabling the mounting of multiple GFS2
filesystems.

The format of \fILockTableName\fR is lock-module-specific.  For
\fIlock_dlm\fR, the format is \fIclustername:fsname\fR.  For
\fIlock_nolock\fR, the field is ignored.

The default cluster/filesystem name is written to disk initially when creating
the filesystem with \fBmkfs.gfs2\fP(8), -t option.  It can be changed on-disk
by using the \fBtunegfs2\fP(8) command.

The \fBlocktable\fP mount option should be used only under special
circumstances in which you want to mount the filesystem in a different cluster,
or mount it as a different filesystem name, without changing the on-disk
default.
.TP
\fBlocalflocks\fP
This flag tells GFS2 that it is running as a local (not clustered) filesystem,
so it can allow the kernel VFS layer to do all flock and fcntl file locking.
When running in cluster mode, these file locks require inter-node locks,
and require the support of GFS2.  When running locally, better performance
is achieved by letting VFS handle the whole job.

This is turned on automatically by the lock_nolock module.
.TP
\fBerrors=\fP\fI[panic|withdraw]\fR
Setting errors=panic causes GFS2 to oops when encountering an error that
would otherwise cause the
mount to withdraw or print an assertion warning. The default setting
is errors=withdraw. This option should not be used in a production system.
It replaces the earlier \fBdebug\fP option on kernel versions 2.6.31 and
above.
.TP
\fBacl\fP
Enables POSIX Access Control List \fBacl\fP(5) support within GFS2.
.TP
\fBspectator\fP
Mount this filesystem using a special form of read-only mount.  The mount
does not use one of the filesystem's journals. The node is unable to
recover journals for other nodes.
.TP
\fBnorecovery\fP
A synonym for spectator
.TP
\fBsuiddir\fP
Sets owner of any newly created file or directory to be that of parent
directory, if parent directory has S_ISUID permission attribute bit set.
Sets S_ISUID in any new directory, if its parent directory's S_ISUID is set.
Strips all execution bits on a new file, if parent directory owner is different
from owner of process creating the file.  Set this option only if you know
why you are setting it.
.TP
\fBquota=\fP\fI[off/account/quiet/on]\fR
Turns quotas on or off for a filesystem.  Setting the quotas to be in
the "account" state causes the per UID/GID usage statistics to be
correctly maintained by the filesystem, limit and warn values are
ignored.  The "quiet" state is equivalent to "on", without writing
warnings about soft and hard quota limits to the system log.
The default value is "off".
.TP
\fBdiscard\fP
Causes GFS2 to generate "discard" I/O requests for blocks which have
been freed. These can be used by suitable hardware to implement
thin-provisioning and similar schemes. This feature is supported
in kernel version 2.6.30 and above.
.TP
\fBbarrier\fP
This option, which defaults to on, causes GFS2 to send I/O barriers
when flushing the journal. The option is automatically turned off
if the underlying device does not support I/O barriers. We highly
recommend the use of I/O barriers with GFS2 at all times unless
the block device is designed so that it cannot lose its write cache
content (e.g. its on a UPS, or it doesn't have a write cache)
.TP
\fBcommit=\fP\fIsecs\fR
This is similar to the ext3 \fBcommit=\fP option in that it sets
the maximum number of seconds between journal commits if there is
dirty data in the journal. The default is 60 seconds. This option
is only provided in kernel versions 2.6.31 and above.
.TP
\fBdata=\fP\fI[ordered|writeback]\fR
When data=ordered is set, the user data modified by a transaction is
flushed to the disk before the transaction is committed to disk.  This
should prevent the user from seeing uninitialized blocks in a file
after a crash.  Data=writeback mode writes the user data to the disk
at any time after it's dirtied.  This doesn't provide the same
consistency guarantee as ordered mode, but it should be slightly
faster for some workloads.  The default is ordered mode.
.TP
\fBmeta\fP
This option results in selecting the meta filesystem root rather than
the normal filesystem root. This option is normally only used by
the GFS2 utility functions. Altering any file on the GFS2 meta filesystem
may render the filesystem unusable, so only experts in the GFS2
on-disk layout should use this option.
.TP
\fBquota_quantum=\fP\fIsecs\fR
This sets the number of seconds for which a change in the quota
information may sit on one node before being written to the quota
file. This is the preferred way to set this parameter. The value
is an integer number of seconds greater than zero. The default is
60 seconds. Shorter settings result in faster updates of the lazy
quota information and less likelihood of someone exceeding their
quota. Longer settings make filesystem operations involving quotas
faster and more efficient.
.TP
\fBstatfs_quantum=\fP\fIsecs\fR
Setting statfs_quantum to 0 is the preferred way to set the slow version
of statfs. The default value is 30 secs which sets the maximum time
period before statfs changes will be syned to the master statfs file.
This can be adjusted to allow for faster, less accurate statfs values
or slower more accurate values. When set to 0, statfs will always
report the true values.
.TP
\fBstatfs_percent=\fP\fIvalue\fR
This setting provides a bound on the maximum percentage change in
the statfs information on a local basis before it is synced back
to the master statfs file, even if the time period has not
expired. If the setting of statfs_quantum is 0, then this setting
is ignored.
.TP
\fBrgrplvb\fP
This flag tells gfs2 to look for information about a resource group's free
space and unlinked inodes in its glock lock value block. This keeps gfs2 from
having to read in the resource group data from disk, speeding up allocations in
some cases.  This option was added in the 3.6 Linux kernel. Prior to this
kernel, no information was saved to the resource group lvb. \fBNote:\fP To
safely turn on this option, all nodes mounting the filesystem must be running
at least a 3.6 Linux kernel. If any nodes had previously mounted the filesystem
using older kernels, the filesystem must be unmounted on all nodes before it
can be mounted with this option enabled. This option does not need to be
enabled on all nodes using a filesystem.
.TP
\fBloccookie\fP
This flag tells gfs2 to use location based readdir cookies, instead of its
usual filename hash readdir cookies.  The filename hash cookies are not
guaranteed to be unique, and as the number of files in a directory increases,
so does the likelihood of a collision.  NFS requires readdir cookies to be
unique, which can cause problems with very large directories (over 100,000
files). With this flag set, gfs2 will try to give out location based cookies.
Since the cookie is 31 bits, gfs2 will eventually run out of unique cookies,
and will fail back to using hash cookies. The maximum number of files that
could have unique location cookies assuming perfectly even hashing and names of
8 or fewer characters is 1,073,741,824. An average directory should be able to
give out well over half a billion location based cookies. This option was added
in the 4.5 Linux kernel. Prior to this kernel, gfs2 did not add directory
entries in a way that allowed it to use location based readdir cookies.
\fBNote:\fP To safely turn on this option, all nodes mounting the filesystem
must be running at least a 4.5 Linux kernel. If this option is only enabled on
some of the nodes mounting a filesystem, the cookies returned by nodes using
this option will not be valid on nodes that are not using this option, and vice
versa.  Finally, when first enabling this option on a filesystem that had been
previously mounted without it, you must make sure that there are no outstanding
cookies being cached by other software, such as NFS.

.SH SETUP

GFS2 clustering is driven by the dlm, which depends on dlm_controld to provide
clustering from userspace.  dlm_controld clustering is built on corosync
cluster/group membership and messaging. GFS2 also requires clustered lvm which
is provided by lvmlockd or, previously, clvmd. Refer to the documentation for
each of these components and ensure that they are configured before setting up
a GFS2 filesystem. Also refer to your distribution's documentation for any
specific support requirements.

Ensure that gfs2-utils is installed on all nodes which mount the filesystem as
it provides scripts required for correct withdraw event response.

.B 1. Create the gfs2 filesystem

mkfs.gfs2 -p lock_dlm -t cluster_name:fs_name -j num /path/to/storage

The cluster_name must match the name configured in corosync (and thus dlm).
The fs_name must be a unique name for the filesystem in the cluster.
The -j option is the number of journals to create; there must
be one for each node that will mount the filesystem.

.PP
.B 2. Mount the gfs2 filesystem

If you are using a clustered resource manager, see its documentation for
enabling a gfs2 filesystem resource. Otherwise, run:

mount /path/to/storage /mountpoint

Run "dlm_tool ls" to verify the nodes that have each fs mounted.

.PP
.B 3. Shut down

If you are using a clustered resource manager, see its documentation for
disabling a gfs2 filesystem resource. Otherwise, run:

umount -a -t gfs2
