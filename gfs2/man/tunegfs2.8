.SH NAME
tunegfs2 - View and manipulate gfs2 superblocks

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tunegfs2
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]
/dev/blockdevice

.SH DESCRIPTION
tunegfs2 allows viewing and manipulating the values contained in a
GFS or GFS2 superblock. It is able to modify the \fIUUID\fR (on GFS2 only),
\fIlabel\fR, \fIlockproto\fR and \fIlocktable\fR.

The values in the GFS2 superblock are read only on mount. Any
changes on a live filesystem will not take effect until the next
time it is mounted. Making changes on a live filesystem is not
recommended for this reason.
